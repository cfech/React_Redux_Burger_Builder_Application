This is a course project for "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (he is really good!) on udemy. link: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/


## What is the project?
This project is made with React.js using css modules, React Router, Redux and Firebase. 
It allows the user to create a burger and submit their "order" to a firebase database. 


## What is the purpose of this project/class?
It allows the developer to learn how to make a react application, and impliment the skills/subject taught in real time through the development of this app, adding complexity over time. It exposes the student to the very basics of react such as create-react-app, class vs funcitonal components, and state, to some more advanced topics such as react-router, query params, asynchronous functions, redux and authentication. The student is also exposed to some extra content such as styled components, webpack, component life cycle methods, testing, and next.js
